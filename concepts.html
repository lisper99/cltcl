    <p> The clTcl package embeds Tcl/Tk in Common Lisp. It parses Tcl
    scripts into lists of strings. These strings are properly escaped
    so they can be send to a Tcl/Tk interpreter. The package provides
    an interface to launch Tcl/Tk and setup a two-way stream for
    communication. Finally it provides synchronized communication
    between Lisp and Tcl/Tk.</p>

    <h2>Embedded Tcl</h2>

    <p>Tcl scripts are parsed into list of strings. Just like Lisp,
    Tcl has a uniform syntax that is easily parsed. A Tcl script is a
    list of commands. The script is read and every command becoms a
    properly escaped string.</p>

    <p>Reader macro <small>#TCL[]</small> reads the Tcl script between
    square brackets.</p>

    <h2>Running Tcl/Tk</h2>

    <p>A running clTcl program is a Lisp process and a Tcl/Tk process
    that communicate via a two-way stream. Launching Tcl/Tk is
    implementation dependent. The stream is available via global
    *stream*.</p>
    
    <h2>The event loop</h2>

    <p>The event-loop is synchronized with Tcl/Tk's event loop. There
    is a single flow of control that switches back and forth between
    Lisp and Tcl/Tk.  </p>

    <p>The event-loop starts a Tcl/Tk process, loads the given script
    and starts listening for events. When the user exits the
    application the event-loop terminates and so does the application.</p>

    <p>The typical flow of control during a cycle in the event loop is
      <ol>
	<li>
	  A Tcl procedure gets triggered by a user action.
	</li>
	
	<li>If the Lisp side needs to be involved it is called with
	  Tcl proc callLisp. It calls a function on the Lisp side and
	  waits for a result.
	</li>

	<li>The called Lisp function does its business. If needed it
	  calls Tcl/Tk. When the Lisp function is done its return
	  value gets passed back to Tcl/Tk. The event finishes and
	  Tcl/Tk waits for the next one.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
